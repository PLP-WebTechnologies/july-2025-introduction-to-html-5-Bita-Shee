                        <p>Dancing is my passion. I love expressing myself through movement and music. Whether it's salsa, hip-hop, or ballet, dancing brings me joy and keeps me active.</p>
                        <p>My favorite dance include salsa, bachata, kizomba and a little bit of kompa but i generally enjoy music and I'll be sure to join in in any tune.</p>
